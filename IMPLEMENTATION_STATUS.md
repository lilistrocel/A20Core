## 🔐 Security Considerations

- JWT_SECRET must be changed in production (64-char random hex recommended)
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- API keys hashed with SHA-256
- License keys hashed with SHA-256
- Session tokens hashed for storage
- All timestamps in UTC
- Input validation on all fields
- Organization name normalization to prevent duplicates
