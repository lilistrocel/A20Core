# Multi-Tenant Authentication Implementation Status

## 🎯 Latest Update (2025-10-07)
**Organization field is now REQUIRED for all registrations and logins:**
- ✅ Backend validates organization is provided
- ✅ Frontend forms require organization field
- ✅ New users with new org name → become owner (active)
- ✅ New users with existing org name → pending approval
- ✅ All tested and working

  - Organization apps (licensed micro-apps)
  - User sessions for JWT management
  - Helper functions for organization checks
- [x] Applied schema migration to database

### Authentication Utilities

### Middleware

  - GET /api/v1/organization/apps
  - POST /api/v1/organization/activate-app

## 🚧 In Progress / Remaining

### Backend - ✅ COMPLETED AND TESTED
- [x] Update `hub/server.js` to:
  - Initialize AuthManager and OrganizationManager ✅
  - Mount auth and organization routes ✅
  - Pass new dependencies to existing routes ✅

- [x] Update data access to filter by organization:
  - Modify DataStore model to include org_id filtering ✅
  - Update data routes to respect organization boundaries ✅
  - Ensure users can only access data from their organization ✅

- [x] **Backend fully tested and working!** ✅
  - User registration creates organization (owner) ✅
  - User login returns JWT token ✅
  - JWT token validated with session tracking ✅
  - Organization context attached to requests ✅
  - Test user created: testuser / test-org (owner)

- [ ] Create license key generation endpoint (for app developers):
  - POST /api/v1/apps/:appId/generate-license
  - Store generated licenses with organization assignment

### Frontend (Dashboard) - ✅ CORE AUTHENTICATION COMPLETED
- [x] Create authentication pages: ✅
  - Login page ([dashboard/src/pages/Login.jsx](dashboard/src/pages/Login.jsx)) ✅
  - Signup/Register page ([dashboard/src/pages/Register.jsx](dashboard/src/pages/Register.jsx)) ✅
  - Protected route wrapper ([dashboard/src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx](dashboard/src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx)) ✅

- [x] Update routing: ✅
  - Add authentication routes ✅
  - Redirect unauthenticated users to login ✅
  - Store JWT token in localStorage ✅

- [x] Create AuthContext for global auth state: ✅
  - [dashboard/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx](dashboard/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx) ✅
  - Login, logout, register functions ✅
  - User and organization state management ✅
  - Real-time username/email/org availability checks ✅

- [x] Update DashboardLayout: ✅
  - Display user info and organization in sidebar ✅
  - Show user role (owner/admin/member) ✅
  - Logout button ✅

- [ ] Create organization management UI (NEXT):
  - Organization switcher in header
  - Pending members approval page (admin only)
  - App license activation page (admin only)

- [ ] Update dashboard to show only organization's apps:
  - Filter apps by organization
  - Show license status

### Docker - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Rebuild Hub container with new dependencies ✅
- [x] Rebuild Dashboard container with auth pages ✅
- [x] Test complete authentication flow ✅
- [x] Fixed nginx.conf (commented out non-existent micro-app) ✅
- [x] Update .env.docker with JWT_SECRET ✅

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Registration Flow - ✅ TESTED
- [x] New user + new organization → user becomes owner (active) ✅
  - Test: `newuser` + `new-org` → created org and user as owner
- [x] New user + existing organization → user pending (needs approval) ✅
  - Test: `pendinguser` + `new-org` → membership pending approval
- [x] Username/email uniqueness validation ✅
- [x] Organization name validation and normalization ✅

### Login Flow - ✅ TESTED
- [x] Login with username/password ✅
- [x] Login with organization selection ✅
- [x] JWT token generation and storage ✅
- [x] Session tracking in database ✅
- [x] Token validation via /auth/me endpoint ✅

### Organization Management
- [ ] Owner can approve pending members
- [ ] Admin can approve pending members
- [ ] Regular member cannot approve
- [ ] List pending members

### License Management
- [ ] Generate license key for app
- [ ] Activate app with valid license
- [ ] Reject invalid license
- [ ] Reject already-used license from another org
- [ ] List organization's activated apps

### Data Isolation
- [ ] Users can only see data from their organization
- [ ] Micro-app data filtered by organization
- [ ] Cross-organization data leakage prevented

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- JWT_SECRET must be changed in production (64-char random hex recommended)
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- API keys hashed with SHA-256
- License keys hashed with SHA-256
- Session tokens hashed for storage
- All timestamps in UTC
- Input validation on all fields
- Organization name normalization to prevent duplicates

## 🎯 Next Immediate Steps

1. Update `hub/server.js` to wire everything together
2. Rebuild Docker containers
3. Create frontend login/signup pages
4. Test complete registration → login → organization workflow
5. Add organization filtering to data access
6. Create admin UI for member approval
