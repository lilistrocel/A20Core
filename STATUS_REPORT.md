The A64 Core system now has a **complete, production-ready multi-tenant authentication and user management system** with comprehensive password security features.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture ✅
- **Organization-based data isolation**: Every data operation requires and enforces `org_id`
- **Role-based access control**: owner, admin, member roles with different permissions
- **JWT authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with 7-day expiry
- **Session tracking**: All active sessions tracked in database
- **API key authentication**: For micro-app to Hub communication

### 2. User Management System ✅
**Admin/Owner Features:**
- View all organization members with status
- Create users with auto-generated temporary passwords
- Display temporary passwords securely (copy-paste ready)
- Suspend/revoke member access
- Reactivate suspended members
- Protected routes (admin/owner access only)

**Member Approval Workflow:**
- Pending Members page for new registrations
- One-click approval process
- Real-time status updates
- Automatic email notifications (when configured)

### 3. Password Management System ✅
**Force Password Change:**
- Auto-generated 12-character cryptographic temporary passwords
- Automatic redirect to password change page on first login
- Cannot access system until password is changed
- Secure logout and re-login after change

**Settings Page:**
- **Profile Tab**: View username, email, full name, organization, role
- **Security Tab**: Self-service password change with:
  - Current password verification
  - Password strength indicator (Weak/Medium/Strong)
  - Real-time validation with visual checkmarks:
    - ✓ At least 6 characters
    - ✓ One uppercase letter
    - ✓ One lowercase letter
    - ✓ One number
  - Show/hide password toggles
  - Auto-logout after successful change

### 4. User Experience Features ✅
**Limbo Page:**
- Dedicated page for suspended users (shows "Account Suspended" message)
- Dedicated page for pending users (shows "Awaiting Approval" message)
- User information display
- Clean logout functionality
- Prevents dashboard access for non-active members

**Login Flow:**
- Simple login (username/password only - organization auto-selected)
- Real-time validation
- Automatic routing based on user status:
  - Suspended → Limbo page
  - Pending → Limbo page
  - Temp password → Force password change
  - Active → Dashboard

**Registration:**
- Create organization or join existing one
- Username/email availability check
- Password strength validation
- Automatic pending status for existing organizations

### 5. Security Features ✅
- **Password hashing**: bcrypt with 10 rounds
- **API key hashing**: SHA-256
- **JWT tokens**: Signed with secret, 7-day expiry
- **Session management**: Database-tracked sessions
- **Automatic logout**: After password changes
- **Protected routes**: Authentication required
- **Role-based access**: Admin features hidden from members
- **Audit logging**: All operations tracked

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test Admin Account
```
URL: http://localhost:8080/login
Username: admin
Password: admin123
Organization: admin-org
```

### Test Workflows

**1. Create User with Temporary Password:**
```
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to "User Management"
3. Click "Create User"
4. Enter: username, email, full name
5. Click "Create User"
6. Copy the temporary password (e.g., a3f4e8b2c1d5)
7. Share with user
```

**2. First Login with Temporary Password:**
```
1. User logs in with temp password
2. Automatically redirected to Force Password Change page
3. Enter new password (meets requirements)
4. Confirm password
5. Click "Change Password"
6. Auto-logout
7. Login with new password → Dashboard access
```

**3. Change Password in Settings:**

1. Login as any user
2. Click "Settings" in sidebar
3. Go to "Security" tab
4. Enter current password
5. Enter new password (watch strength indicator)
6. Confirm password
7. Click "Change Password"
8. Auto-logout after 2 seconds

5. Admin clicks "Reactivate" button
6. Member status → "Active"
7. Member can login successfully
```

**5. Approve Pending Member:**

## 📊 System Architecture

### Data Flow

**User Login:**
```
Frontend Login → POST /api/v1/auth/login → AuthManager.login()
  → Verify password (bcrypt)
  → Check organization membership
  → Generate JWT token
  → Create session in database
  → Return: { user, token, organization, force_password_change, membership_status }
  → Frontend checks flags:
      - membership_status? → Limbo page
      - force_password_change? → Force password change page
      - else → Dashboard
```

**Data Operation (Multi-tenant):**
```
Frontend Request → API Route → authMiddleware.authenticate
  → Extract org_id from JWT
  → Call DataStore method with org_id
  → DataStore.upsertData({ ...data, org_id })
  → SQL: WHERE org_id = $X (enforced in query)
  → auditMiddleware.log (track operation)
  → Return filtered data
```

**Password Change:**
```
Settings Page → POST /api/v1/auth/change-password
  → AuthManager.changePassword(userId, oldPassword, newPassword)
  → Verify old password
  → Hash new password (bcrypt, 10 rounds)
  → Update users table
  → Clear force_password_change flag
  → Revoke all sessions (force re-login)
  → Return success
  → Frontend auto-logout
```
